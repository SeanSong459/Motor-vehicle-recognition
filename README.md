# find-similar-cars
This weekâ€™s task is to create a prototype that allows a user to upload the picture of a  car, and then find a similar car in their stock to recommend to customers.
I went with Google Vision's AutoML, which allows you to train high-quality custom machine learning models, after which the trained model was exported as a TensorFlow.js to be used in the browser.
